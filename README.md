Hello, this my pet-project where I apply tech stack:
- SCSS for styles components;
- FSD for architectures project;
- RTK Query for fetching and caching datas from API;
- Redux for save states;
- TypeScript for data typing.
- Strapi for emulating back-end.
  
If you want to view the deployment of this project you should run back-end part from repositories https://github.com/DevelopReact/my-project.git
